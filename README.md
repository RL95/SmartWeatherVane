# Smart Weather Vane (project SAFE)
A smart weather vane used for mounting various sensors on rooftops.

The project was developped at the [The University of Applied Sciences and Arts of Western Switzerland](https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/groupe/aero-nautique-spatiale) for the project [SAFE (Simulator of Autonomous Flight Environments)](https://www.hesge.ch/hepia/recherche-developpement/projets-recherche/safe-0), which aims to measure and replicate atmospheric turbulence at drone scale in an autonomous flight environment simulator for drone certification.
